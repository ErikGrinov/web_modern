A recruitment website with a frontend (client) and backend (service) was created. The database is PostgreeSQL. Prisma ORM was used to connect the website to the database.
The website has not been deployed
I used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend

You can register on the site as a company and a scientist.

The company creates vacancies, and the scientist calls out. 
When the scientist responds, a message about this will be sent to the company's personal account.
